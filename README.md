# Build-a-survey-for-obsidian
This is a Project within FreeCodeCamp Where I get to build my own Survey where I chose to make a survey for the experience of Obsidian.

## Techniques
I got to use
- label
- input
- textarea
- form
- section
- div
- and alot of diffrent attributes and values

## Thoughts
I thought this project was interesting because It let me build a Survey and I think it's a powerful thing to learn. This was also the first project where I felt a little overwhelmed by all the code on the screen and trying to find exactly what im looking for when I was coding. I think trying to structure the code more will help me alot in the future.

## Diffiulty
This was a Medium project. I'll definitly encounter harder projects but with the skill level I currently have I still had to use my brain and think about certain things and I did learn alot from this Project.
